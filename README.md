The program I designed is a text-based word puzzle game named WordChain. It features an 8×8 grid where players select adjacent letters to form valid words from a predefined dictionary. The game includes power-ups: Shuffle (regenerates the grid), Freeze (temporarily halts player input for 5 seconds), and Bomb (replaces selected letters with random ones). Players score 10 points per valid letter used, and power-ups drop randomly with a low probability. The grid is intelligently generated with ~30% vowels to ensure playability.

For whom：
This game is suitable for language learners, word game enthusiasts and casual players who enjoy puzzle challenges. Whether they are students, office workers or family members, everyone can enhance their vocabulary and thinking response ability through this game. It is suitable for all age groups.

Why I developed this app：
I developed this game in order to combine learning with entertainment. It can not only train players' spelling and vocabulary recognition abilities, but also enhance the fun and challenge of the game through props and scoring mechanisms, allowing people to learn, relax and improve themselves in a relaxed atmosphere.
